# Functions
- Case() -> takes input t i.e number of test cases and runs a loop of solve() t times
<hr>
- GraphUNW(n) -> Initializes a vector of arrays 'adj' with n vertices using adjecency list.
- addEdgeDirect(adj,u,v) -> Adds a directed edge from u to v
- addEdgeUnDirect(adj,u,v) -> Adds an undirected edge from u to v
- dfs(adj,n) -> runs dfs on our graph and prints each element. can be modified to store each element in vector
